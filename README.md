Here’s a complete `README.md` file for your **Local Network Device Scanner** GitHub project — it's clean, professional, and highlights the JD-relevant skills like OOP, TCP/IP, testing, and practical Python development:

#  Local Network Device Scanner (Python TCP/IP)

A simple Python tool to scan a local IP range and identify devices that are alive by attempting TCP connections (default: port 80). Designed with OOP principles, socket programming, and unit testing support.

---

## Features

- **TCP/IP Socket Scanning** (connect to specific port to test availability)
- **Object-Oriented Design** (`Scanner`, `ScanResult`)
- **Unit Testing** with `unittest`
- Simple CLI output for live/unreachable IPs
- Easily extendable for port scanning, logging, or dashboards

## Project Structure

```

network\_scanner/
├── scanner.py          # Core scanning logic
├── run.py              # CLI script to launch scan
├── utils.py            # IP range generator + result logger
├── test\_scanner.py     # Unit tests
└── README.md           # You're reading it!

````

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- No external libraries (only uses `socket`, `unittest`)

---

## Usage

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/karti-mone/network-scanner.git
cd network-scanner
````

2. **Edit scan range in `run.py` as needed:**

```python
BASE_IP = '192.168.1.'
START = 1
END = 10
```

3. **Run the scanner:**

```bash
python run.py
```

4. **Example Output:**

```
Scanning 192.168.1.1 to 192.168.1.10 on port 80...

[✔] 192.168.1.1 is alive (15.2 ms)
[✖] 192.168.1.2 is unreachable
...
```

---

## Run Tests

```bash
python test_scanner.py
```
---

## Concepts Demonstrated

* Python Sockets (`socket.create_connection`)
* TCP/IP fundamentals
* Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
* Clean code and modularity
* Unit Testing (with `unittest`)
